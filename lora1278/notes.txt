BW < 62.5 kHz requires TCXO, otherwise XTAL is ok
wider BW - shorter/faster transmittion
SF7 - fastest, SF12 - most sensitive
SF6 is special
CR4/5 - fastest, CR4/8 - reliable. Header is always 4/8
Symbol rate Rs=BW/2^S. one chip is sent per second per Hz of bandwidth

RSSI (dBm) = -157 + Rssi, (when using the High Frequency (HF) port) 862-1020
RSSI (dBm) = -164 + Rssi, (when using the Low Frequency (LF) port) 410-525, 137-175

Packet Strength (dBm) = -157 + Rssi, (when using the High Frequency (HF) port)
Packet Strength (dBm) = -164 + Rssi, (when using the Low Frequency (LF) port)

Packet Strength (dBm) = -157 + PacketRssi + PacketSnr * 0.25 (when using the HF port and SNR < 0)
Packet Strength (dBm) = -164 + PacketRssi + PacketSnr * 0.25 (when using the LF port and SNR < 0)

PacketRssi (in RegPktRssiValue), is an averaged version of Rssi (in RegRssiValue). Rssi can be read at any time
(during packet reception or not), and should be averaged to give more precise results.

The registers in the address space from 0x61 to 0x73 are specific for operation in the lower frequency bands (below 525
MHz), or in the upper frequency bands (above 779 MHz).

434 MHz - 0x6c8000
868 MHz - 0xd90024
